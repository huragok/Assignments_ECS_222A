    %   PROBLEM 1
    %----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \begin{homeworkProblem}
        Read (or skim, since we discussed it in class) the first 4 sections of
        the Bender et al. paper on the LCA problem. In class we derived a
        preprocessing time of $O(\sqrt{n}\times(2n/(\log_2n))^3)$ to build the
        tables for all the binary vectors. In the Bender paper, the time stated
        for that is faster by a factor of $(2n/\log_2 n)$. How do they achieve
        this improvement? (This is an easy problem given what we have already
        done in this class, but it makes sure you understand the method.)

    %----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    %   PROBLEM 2
    %----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \begin{homeworkProblem}
        Now, read Section 5 of the LCA paper of Bender et al. In that paper,
        they call the Range Query problem that we discussed in class (where the
        list $L$ comes from a tree) the +-1RMQ problem. In section 5, they show
        how to solve the general RMQ problem (where the consecutive values can
        differ by any amount). They show that the general RMQ problem can be
        solved in constant time, after $O(n)$ preprocessing, i.e., just as fast
        as the +-1RMQ. This is done by reducing the general RMQ problem to an
        LCA problem on a tree, in $O(n)$ time. Call LCA problem that the RMQ
        problem reduces to, the RLCA problem, and use $RT$ to refer to the tree
        used in the RLCA problem.
        
        \begin{homeworkSection}{\homeworkProblemName(a)}
            Is this an amazing result, or what? I mean, the fact that any LCA
            query can be answered in constant time, after only linear-time
            preprocessing, is already amazing, but probably one would
            (hand-waivingly) explain that it is somehow due to the fact that
            the adjacent $L$ values differ by +1 or -1, which allows a
            4-Russianâ€™s approach. But, then to see that in fact, that condition
            is not needed \ldots

        \begin{homeworkSection}{\homeworkProblemName(b)}
            In class, we said that in some applications, only the LCAs of two
            leaves of a tree $T$ are ever needed. In this true of the $RT$ trees
            used to solve RLCA problems, in order to solve general RMQ problems?
            (This is also an easy problem, only really intended to be sure you
            read and understood Section 5.)

    %   PROBLEM 3
    %----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \begin{homeworkProblem}
        Read (or skim, since we have already discussed it in class) the Wagner
        paper on global minimum cut in an undirected graph.
        
        \begin{homeworkSection}{\homeworkProblemName(a)}
            In the last sentence of Section 2, they state: 
            \begin{quotation}
                ``Notice that the starting vertex a stays the same throughout
                the whole algorithm. It can be selected arbitrarily in each phase
                instead.''
            \end{quotation}
            
            Make an explicit argument for this claim.

            \problemAnswer{
            
            }
        \end{homeworkSection}
        
        \begin{homeworkSection}{\homeworkProblemName(b)}
            It is known that in any edge-weighted undirected graph with $n$
            nodes, there is a set $S$ of at most $n âˆ’ 1$ cuts (bipartitions of
            the nodes), such that for any pair of nodes $s, t$ (there are
            $\left(\begin{array}{l}n\\2\end{array}\right)$ pairs of
            nodes), $S$ will contain a minimum $s âˆ’ t$ cut.

            Do the $n âˆ’ 1$ minimum cuts found by the Wagner algorithm form such
            a set $S$? Prove that they do, or find a counter-example.

    %   PROBLEM 4
    %----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \begin{homeworkProblem}
        Parametric P-P problem (this is probably the most time-consuming
        problem, but it mostly requires that you understand the Preflow-Push
        method.)
        
        Recall that in HW 4, you showed that if $f$ is some non-maximum $s âˆ’ t$
        flow in a graph $G$, and $G_f$ is the residual flow graph with respect
        to $f$, then a maximum $s âˆ’ t$ flow in $G$ can be obtained by
        superimposing $f$ with the maximum $s-t$ flow $g$ in $G_f$.
        
        Suppose one wants to compute a sequence of $k$ maximum $s-t$ flows in a
        graph $G$, where between each flow computation the capacity on each edge
        out of $s$ is either unchanged or increased, and all other capacities
        are left constant. We call this a parametric flow problem. There are
        many problems which can be solved by such a sequence of flow
        computations. If we consider each flow as an independent computation,
        the best resulting time bound is $O(kn^3)$.
        
        \begin{homeworkSection}{\homeworkProblemName(a)}
            Using the result from HW 4, restated above, give a brief argument
            that the $(i+1)$ $s-t$ flow can be computed by changing the
            capacities on the edges out of $s$ to s in the last residual graph
            used in the $i$-th maximum flow computation, and then finding the
            maximum flow in that altered residual graph. Essentially, then we
            are computing the $(i + 1)$ $s-t$ flow, starting with the $i$-th
            flow in the $(i + 1)$ $s-t$ graph.
            
            \vspace{10pt}
            \problemAnswer{    
            }
        \end{homeworkSection}
        
        \begin{homeworkSection}{\homeworkProblemName(b)}
            Now we explore how the variant of the Preflow-Push algorithm which
            always picks the active node with largest d value works in this
            parametric environment.
            
            Argue that the following method correctly computes the $i + 1$ $s-t$
            maximum flow in the sequence.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item In the last residual graph used by the Preflow-Push
                algorithm in the $i$-th flow computation, remove all edges into
                $s$, and remove every node, other than s, whose $d$ label is $n$
                or greater. Leave all of the node labels $d$ on the remaining
                nodes unchanged. Call this graph $G'$.
                \item Increase the capacities (as given by the new capacity
                data) of every edge of $G'$ out of s to a remaining node in
                $G'$. This might create new forward edges. Call this graph
                $G''$.
                \item Saturate all the edges in $G''$ out of $s$.
                \item With this preflow, and the existing $d$ labels, continue
                with the preflow-push algorithm, with the maximum $d$ variant,
                on $G''$. When it stops, superimpose its flow with the flow
                for the $i$-th problem in the sequence. We claim that this gives
                a maximum flow in the $i + 1$ $s-t$ graph in the sequence.
            \end{enumerate}
            The key to proving that this is correct is to first show that Step 3
            does indeed create a preflow in $G''$, and the node labels are
            valid for that preflow. After that, you only need to briefly argue
            that the overall algorithm is correct.

            \problemAnswer{    
            }
        \end{homeworkSection}
        
        So far, we havenâ€™t made much progress, since the time for each running
        of the above algorithm is bounded only by $O(n^3)$. But, I believe that
        the entire sequence of $k$ flows can be computed in $O(n^3 + kn)$ time,
        which is a dramatic improvement over the method that starts each flow
        from scratch. We will explore this in the next homework (or you can get
        started now).
